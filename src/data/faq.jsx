        "answer": <>
            <p>
                CTFs (Abbreviation for Capture The Flag) are a type of computer security competition.
                Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling)
                skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved,
                each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service.
            </p>
            <p>
                CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment,
                and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice.

                Developing skills in the area of cyber security opens up a whole new range of career opportunities for
                skilled graduates. Today graduates with expertise in cyber security are in great demand for the
                positions of security analysts in top private computer firms in India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course apart from the private computer firms, the Electronic and Computer Science Division of DRDO
                (Defence Research and Development Organization), which is the government wing that currently handles
                the national cyber security, is also in need of cyber security professionals with skills, agility and
                a fresh and updated outlook at cyber security.

            The Internet! The competition will be indefinitely available online at this website. As long as you
            have the ability to install software and have unfiltered Internet access, the participants can compete
            from anywhere in India.

                The challenges from the previous round of InCTFj are accessible. The detailed solutions to these
                challenges will be put up later on. New users can use these solutions to learn as the challenges
                for this round might cover similar concepts as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                It might also be helpful to learn a bit of programming in languages such as C, Python, Javascript and HTML.

        "question": "What constitutes as cheating?",
        "answer": <>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Attacking the scoring server, other teams, or machines not explicitly designated as targets is cheating.
                    This includes both breaking into such machines and denying others access to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sharing solutions or providing overly-revealing hints with other teams is cheating, as is being
                    directly assisted by personnel other than contest admins (using tools from the internet is OK;
                    asking people on the internet to help you solve the problem is not).
                </li>
                <li>
                    We encourage you to solve problems in novel and creative ways using all available resources,
                    but we do require that you solve them yourselves.
                </li>
