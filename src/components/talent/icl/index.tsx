                To make even more students attracted and to keep their interests high even after a InCTF, we are planning to host more CTFs for school students collaborating with schools & other institutions â€“ Indian Cyber League, that shall build a CTF ecosystem in Indian schools.
            </div>
            <div>
                As a first, we hosted the first Amrita Techie Challenge, an inter-school CTF for Amrita Vidyalayams in May, and are exploring other school franchises for such an opportunity.
            </div>
            <div>
                By having rewarding CTFs more regularly and making students participating in it with one's school mates in teams mentored by senior students, we hope to emulate the success of team bi0s which too had started, and still runs like this.
