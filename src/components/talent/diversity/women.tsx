            <h3>Women in CyberSecurity</h3>
            <div>
                There is a disproportionate representation of women pursuing careers in Computing, and especially in Cyber-Security industry.
            </div>
            <div>
                Women comprise only about 20% of cyber-security workforce today.

                We are impassioned & committed to promoting aspiring girls in Cyber-Security.

                We have been recognizing & giving special prizes to the top-ranked women hackers and special scholarships & training programmes for promising
                girl talents through team Shakti.

            <div>
                We have seen the proportion of women participants grow from 10% to above 20% over the years and are working
                towards our target of achieving 50% women participants by 2025.
