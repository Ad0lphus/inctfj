            <h3>Making Learning Cyber Security Accessible Everywhere</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    A reason why we started InCTF is to make learning CyberSecurity accessible in the unprivileged sections of society.

                <div>
                    From our own experience running the bi0s community, we have found that high-quality cyber-security training and resources don't come cheap and thus are out of reach for many.

                <div>
                    With InCTF Junior & our initiatives, we are constantly striving to bridge this gap and provide this platform of equal opportunities for everyone.

            <h3>Our Initiatives to Bridge the Gap.</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    We have been focusing to further penetrate this opportunity to the government-run schools and those in the tier-3 cities & rural regions of India and have managed to bring participants from several new schools every year.
                </div>
                <div>
                    For this, we conduct free workshops & training specially for these schools, often actively involving their teachers and parents, and try to set up a cyber-security club/community there.
