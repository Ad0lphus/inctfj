                In Capture-The-Flag (CTF) game format, the players are tasked to do some activity, upon completion
                they receive a flag which they submit as proof of work.

            <div>
                In our CTFs, these challenges usually involve learning some cybersecurity topics, tools & exploiting
                some vulnerabilities, hands-on using their critical thinking & problem-solving skills.
            </div>
            <div>
                Challenges present scenarios that make students learn fundamental concepts in secure programming,
                cryptography, reverse engineering, forensics, and web security.
            </div>
            <div>
                Players need to analyze problems, devise strategies, tinker with tools & browse resources, use
                creative & critical thinking to find out solutions, often working together with a team.
