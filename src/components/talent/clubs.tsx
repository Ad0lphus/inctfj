                Due to the absence of an ecosystem or peer group, the students often get stuck and don't
                continue learning cyber-security after the InCTF as often they have no idea or motivation to
                continue until the next InCTF.
            </div>
            <div>
                To address this, since the last few years, we have been working closely with Amrita Vidyalayams
                across the country helping to set up cyber-security clubs at their school for forming peer groups
                of these enthusiasts with the help of their teachers.
            </div>
            <div>
                We have seen that schools with such peer-group or clubs send students every year,
                who often come out as winners.
